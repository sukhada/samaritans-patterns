context:
  consideration:
    heading: I understand that some of the things I may hear as a listening volunteer will be difficult.
    paragraph: People contact us when theyre feeling desperate, angry, grieving or in pain. Some of them are feeling suicidal.
    tell_me_more: Some things people tell us can be particularly tough to hear. But you can always take time out and talk it through with another volunteer. When you become a volunteer you join a community of people all facing the same challenges.
